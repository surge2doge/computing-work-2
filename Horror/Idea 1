Today is the first day. First day I am at my new "home". I left. Left from the place I spent so many years in, where I had grown up. It all felt so familiar, now, even as I stand
on the porch of this new house, it felt weird. I feel so out of place. I wished I had a choice, to not move away. Even though the old place was a lot smaller, it felt like home, 
it was home. I sighed as I climbed down the porch, and went out of the fence to allow the men to pass. They were here to carry many of the things we had in the old house. At least
I had something familiar with me......
